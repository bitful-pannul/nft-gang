### ZIG-starter


> this provides the basic dependencies that you need for a gall app from the `urbit/base-dev` and `urbit/landscape` directories, along with the sur, lib and mark files you need for contract development/interaction from `uqbar-dao/uqbar-core`.

This repo assumes that you first have cloned `urbit/urbit`, and clone this into `urbit/pkg/`. `uqbar-dao/uqbar-core` should also be cloned into `urbit/pkg`. This will populate symlinks properly, and when you git pull the parent repo and base-dev/landscape repos have updates, they will change automatically in your project.

I shall add an example agent and trivial contracts+tests soon.
